This book is also useful for  a person who is doing dsa with java during their academic preparations. In all the 
chapters you will see that there is more emphasis on problems and their analysis rather than on theory. In each chapter, you will first read 
about the basic required theory, which is then followed by a section on problem sets. In total, there are approximately 700 algorithmic 
problems, all with solutions.
